# Visualizing-intermediate-activation-CNN-
Visualizing intermediate activation in Convolutional Neural Networks with Keras:

With this implementation, we learn how our layer structure processes the data in terms of visualization of each intermediate activation, 
which consists of displaying the feature maps that are output by the convolution and pooling layers in the network.
